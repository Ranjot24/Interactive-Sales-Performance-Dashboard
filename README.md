# Interactive-Sales-Performance-Dashboard
This project involves creating an interactive sales performance dashboard in Excel using a sample dataset from a fictional retail company. The dashboard will provide insights into total sales, quantities sold, and trends over time, as well as detailed analyses by product, category, region, and customer.
